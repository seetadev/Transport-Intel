# Transport Flow

Monitoring tools for road incident management, reducing traffic congestion. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and safer roads. Decentralized twitter like chat app for emergency help & care (please visit https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Intel/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/flow-decentralized-road-counseling-portal).

Transport Flow is a traffic flow analytics, emergency and congestion management, first aid delivery, road counseling and incident management platform for citizens, police officers, drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web, mobile in a secure and simplified manner using Flow, Ethereum, IPFS, cross blockchain tools and services, Web3 tools aided solution.  We are utilzing Flow eco-system tools to develop an NFT marketplace, provide services to citizens with accesssibility need, provide rental services.

Features:

Real Time Analytics, alerts, streaming: Analytics of the incidents with sentiment analysis, live incident reporting. road safety eco-system. Health summary of the police staff, scheduling the staff. Reducing misinformation.

Decentralized twitter like chat app for emergency help & care.

Incident Dashboard: Manage and track your incidents as a citizen along with sharing reviews and comments. Incident reporting, severity analytics and sentiment analysis using social media data for early stage detection and prevention of incidents.

360 degrees access: Command and control centers can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, enable early stage prevention of accidents and road safety counseling, management of workforce at the incident site.

Community Benefits:

Insurance Companies: Aggregated/ anonymized driving data, incident data will be helpful to car insurance companies.

OEMs and Dealerships: Vehicle diagnostics and in-car service consumption will be helpful for OEMs and Dealerships.

Smart Cities Policy Makers/ Government: Real time traffic flow, incident alert, parking data will be enable safer roads.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the scenario by use of cross chain interoperability in communication.

Citizens and Cab aggregators: Reduction in the number of road accidents.

Advertisers: Customers/driver demographics are available.

Fleet customers: fleet performance.

# Flow Blockchain Eco-system 

USDC enablement with Cadence: We are utilizing USDC implementation using Cadence smart contracts mainly for Government organizations, who would only prefer to use USDC stable coin for providing government subsidies for greener fuel and pollution check credits.  Government organizations can send a USDC from source-chain to destination-chain and distribute it equally among all accounts specified for subsidy or reimbursement using call contract with token. Cross chain lending platform: We can supply collateral and borrow tokens from a satellite chain to a fork of Ethereum's mainnet using existing Compound Protocol. Smart contracts for USDC enablement and extension using Cadence at https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Intel/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/usdc-contracts


Niftory's APIs and wallet apis: We are using Niftory's API to develop no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely SocialCalc, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting. We are utilzing wallet apis for sending NFTs and facilitate peer to peer payments for service, repair and procurement/replenishment of spare parts. Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Intel/tree/main/niftory-wallet-marketplace-service-repair-dapper

FlowNS: We are using FlowNS to develop an NFT storefront and marketplace for NFTs representing NFC tags of vehicle spare parts provided by government agencies (example GeM portal). This enables on-demand availability of spare parts and prevents counterfieting of expensive, repairable spare parts at functional locations. Further, it enables optimaly inventory management and allocation at all repair sites.

We are extending and adapting the Flow blockchain project to enable cross blockchain interoperability and transaction management with Ethereum and Filecoin/IPFS storage. Also, we are extending the project for L2 technologies like Metis to develop rollup capabilities to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system. We are also adapting our solution to enable development of composable, programmatic blocks to generate NFT and ease of identity management using Filecoin Virtual Machine. In this aspect, we are generating an NFT for NFC tags for vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows. Identity management, ability to extend the solution and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Flow and extending its interoperability and eco-system with key Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains and programmatic, composable Filecoin virtual machine. Flow wallet for fuel refill and intermiles: https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Intel/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/fuel-refill-intermiles-wallet


Flowty: We are learning to integrate SocialCalc analytics tooling with flowty rental services to enable availability of car on rent for inter-state travel of passengers, who need accessibility services or need to travel for getting healthy or medical treatment. We are also learning to use secondary marketplace of flowty with SocialCalc to enable sharing of intermiles or fuel miles which can be redeemed in various ecommerce stores. Further, we are trying to use its loan contract services with SocialCalc to enable e-auto drivers to get loans for agencies to fund their commercial vehicles in emergency needs (example Covid Crisis time frame).


Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Flow, Canto, IBC, Cosmos and ethereum blockchain solutions powered by IPFS storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots. Our app solution will enable effective design, engineering and delivery of Flow, Canto, IBC, Cosmos aided solution to make roads safer and better using predictive analytics and automation for incident reporting and reduction in hazardous transportation with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin. Our solution will benefit: 

Police Force 
- 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. Using machine learning they can also predict the incident occurrence at any area. This will help in taking necessary actions in advance to control the traffic. They can also use the solution for effective utilization of staff members and provide road safety counselling.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we will provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.

Canto, Cosmos Smart Contracts and IBC: We are using Canto, IBC, Cosmos Smart Contracts for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early stage incident response and prevention. 

1. Canto enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost effectiveness front.

2. Cosmos interoperability with Ethereum like blockchains. Also, ability to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system.

3. Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

4. We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

5. Identity management, ability to extend the solution using IBC and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Canto.

Canto analytics tooling: investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, incident severity analysis based on the decentralize voting at the IBC chain.
