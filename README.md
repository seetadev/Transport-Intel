# Blockchain Eco-system 

Canto, Cosmos Smart Contracts and IBC: We are using Canto, IBC, Cosmos Smart Contracts for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early stage incident response and prevention. 

1. Canto enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost effectiveness front.

2. Cosmos interoperability with Ethereum like blockchains. Also, ability to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system.

3. Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

4. We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

5. Identity management, ability to extend the solution using IBC and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Canto.

Canto analytics tooling: investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, incident severity analysis based on the decentralize voting at the IBC chain.

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Flow, Canto, IBC, Cosmos and ethereum blockchain solutions powered by IPFS storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots. Our app solution will enable effective design, engineering and delivery of Flow, Canto, IBC, Cosmos aided solution to make roads safer and better using predictive analytics and automation for incident reporting and reduction in hazardous transportation with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin. Our solution will benefit: 

Police Force 
- 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. Using machine learning they can also predict the incident occurrence at any area. This will help in taking necessary actions in advance to control the traffic. They can also use the solution for effective utilization of staff members and provide road safety counselling.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we will provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.
